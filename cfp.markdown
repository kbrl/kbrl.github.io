Submissions should be in **.pdf** format. Since the review process is **double-blind**, all papers should be appropriately anonymised.
Authors have the option of submitting one supplementary manuscript containing further details of their work, it is entirely up to the reviewers to decide whether they wish to consult this additional material.

We also welcome extended abstracts of up to 2 pages that describe open problems and challenges in the area of knowledge-based RL.
The papers will be non-archival, which means we welcome papers that have been published or submitted to other conferences and journals.
However, authors are required to acknowledge their papers' original appearance in such cases.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters.
The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation.
There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees.
