			<td> <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a> <br> <b>Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Princeton NLP</b> <br> Karthik Narasimhan is an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. His research spans the areas of natural language processing and reinforcement learning, with a view towards building intelligent agents that learn to operate in the world through both their own experience and existing human knowledge (ex. text). Karthik received his PhD from MIT in 2017, and spent a year as a visiting research scientist at OpenAI prior to joining Princeton. His work has received a best paper award at EMNLP 2016 and an honorable mention for best paper at EMNLP 2015. </td>

He received AB degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciencefrom UC Berkeley and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. BeforeIBM he worked at NASA, served as a tenured Associate Professor at the Georgia Instituteof Technology, and co-founded and sold an AI startup in Silicon Valley.  His work onmachine learning, statistics, and algorithms for massive datasets, predating the movementof "big data" in industry, has been honored with a number of research awards includingthe NSF CAREER Award, multiple best paper awards, selection as a National Academy ofSciences Kavli Scholar, and service as a member of the 2010 National Academy of SciencesCommittee on the Analysis of Massive Data. His current interests generally revolve aroundthe injection of non-mainstream ideas into ML/AI to attempt to break through long-standingbottlenecks of the field. </font></td>
