			<td> <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a> <br> <b>Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Princeton NLP</b> <br> <font size="2">Karthik Narasimhan is an assistant professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. His research spans the areas of natural language processing and reinforcement learning, with a view towards building intelligent agents that learn to operate in the world through both their own experience and existing human knowledge (ex. text). Karthik received his PhD from MIT in 2017, and spent a year as a visiting research scientist at OpenAI prior to joining Princeton. His work has received a best paper award at EMNLP 2016 and an honorable mention for best paper at EMNLP 2015. </font></td>

			<td> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-gray-b554b64/">Alexander Gray</a> <br> <b>IBM Research</b> <br> <font size="2">Alexander Gray serves as VP of Foundations of AI at IBM, and currently leads IBMâ€™s Neuro-Symbolic AI Theme (distinct from the work in the MIT-IBM Lab). He received AB degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from UC Berkeley and a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. BeforeIBM he worked at NASA, served as a tenured Associate Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and co-founded and sold an AI startup in Silicon Valley.  His work on machine learning, statistics, and algorithms for massive datasets, predating the movement of "big data" in industry, has been honored with a number of research awards including the NSF CAREER Award, multiple best paper awards, selection as a National Academy ofSciences Kavli Scholar, and service as a member of the 2010 National Academy of SciencesCommittee on the Analysis of Massive Data. His current interests generally revolve around the injection of non-mainstream ideas into ML/AI to attempt to break through long-standing bottlenecks of the field. </font></td>

			<td> <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=jp-MICH">Michiaki Tatsubori</a> <br> <b>IBM Research</b> <br> <font size="2"> Dr. Michiaki (Mich) Tatsubori leads the Embodied Learning group. After receiving his PhD from University of Tsukuba, he joined the lab in 2002 to work on Web technologies. In 2013, he moved to Nairobi, Kenya, with his family to work at the newly launched lab of IBM Research - Africa. There, he led software development in research projects such as in-car smartphone-based traffic/road analysis. By using data from smartphones embodied in garbage collection vehicles, the team obtained a map that showed road distress in the city, individual driving quality, and even information on moving obstacles such as carts and animals. He returned to Tokyo in 2017  to  enjoy the Rugby World Cup and Olympics. He has been involved with embodied AI and its applications in robotics, visions, planning, and conversations. He is a certified referee of Mini Rugby.</font></td>
